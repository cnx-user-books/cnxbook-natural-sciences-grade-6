        <item>In the period of the dinosaurs the world was mainly dry and hot. The climate started changing gradually, new animals and plants evolved and others died out. When the climate became warmer and wetter, great forests of giant ferns and a variety of conifers developed. The changing world required the dinosaurs to adapt as well in order to survive. Flowering plants and blossoming trees appeared about 100 million years ago and oak and laurel forests began to grow. Birds, insects and other animals started to develop to eat the nectar and pollen provided by the flowers.</item>
        <item>The dinosaurs disappeared, but their descendants remained behind. When we examine dinosaur fossils it becomes clear that the crocodiles and birds are the closest living relatives of the dinosaurs. The dinosaurs were reptiles. Reptiles actually developed 300 million years ago. Even before the appearance of the dinosaurs, reptiles had developed along different lines to form different groups.</item>

        <item>Some creatures, e.g. the cockroach, have shown hardly any change over millions of years. Horses once were as large as a terrier and lived in forests. Nowadays they are fast long-legged animals that live on the open plains. This kind of change results from a process of natural selection.</item>
