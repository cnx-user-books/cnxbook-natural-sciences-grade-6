        <list id="id5276356" list-type="bulleted">
          <item>This calendar uses the sun as the main means of keeping time. One year therefore measures 365Â¼ days - the exact duration of one of the earth's orbits of the sun. The beginning of the Christian calendar is the birth of Jesus Christ. The years preceding this event are referred to as before Christ or BC, and the years following it are spoken of as anno Domini (the year of the Lord) or AD. </item>
          <item>This calendar is the most commonly used calendar throughout the world (also by non-Christians).</item>

        <para id="id3669548">THE MUSLIM CALENDAR</para>
        <list id="id15779594" list-type="bulleted">
          <item>People in the Muslim community use the moon to keep time. (The moon, being still and lifeless, has no light of its own but merely reflects the light of the sun. The moon therefore is not a star.)</item>
        </list>
        <para id="id4151932">THE JEWISH CALENDAR</para>
        <list id="id4151936" list-type="bulleted">
          <item>Jews use a calendar that refers to the moon for counting the months and the sun for determining the length of the years. This calendar is dated from the time of the Biblical creation of the world.</item>
        </list>
        <list id="id4126825" list-type="bulleted">
          <item>Although the Jewish and Christian calendars use the sun to determine the length of a year, the dates of the Christian and Jewish New Year do not coincide.</item>

        <list id="id4003781" list-type="bulleted">
          <item>The sun and the planet Jupiter are used by the Chinese to calculate time. Jupiter takes about 12 years to complete an orbit of the sun. The Chinese calendar is therefore based on a cycle of twelve years. Each year is named after an animal.</item>
          <item>Each of the animals have particular characteristics, which, according to Chinese belief, are transferred to the people who are born in the particular year.</item>
